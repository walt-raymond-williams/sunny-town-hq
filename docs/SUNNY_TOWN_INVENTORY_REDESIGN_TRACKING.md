# Sunny Town Inventory Redesign Tracking

## Purpose

This document preserves the current GitHub/task workflow state for compaction recovery and fresh-agent handoff. GitHub issues remain the execution source of truth; this file is a local memory snapshot.

## Integration Branch

Current feature integration branch:

`codex/inventory-redesign-dev`

Workflow:

- Agents work issues against `codex/inventory-redesign-dev`.
- Issues may be closed once their work lands on the integration branch and verification is recorded.
- `main` remains stable until the integrated feature slice is ready for human review.
- A human reviews the integrated feature before merging `codex/inventory-redesign-dev` into `main`.

## Recommended Next Management Step

Start issue #15:

`Add inventory drag/drop state and API integration`

Why:

- The first inventory grid foundation slice is complete.
- The HQ move/swap/merge API exists.
- The frontend renders slotted inventory but still behaves like a click-selected grid with legacy buttons.
- Drag/drop is the next bridge toward hotbar and equipment drop targets.
- Handoff: `docs/SUNNY_TOWN_INVENTORY_DRAG_DROP_HANDOFF.md`.
