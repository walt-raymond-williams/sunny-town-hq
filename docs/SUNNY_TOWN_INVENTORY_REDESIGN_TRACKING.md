# Sunny Town Inventory Redesign Tracking

## Purpose

This document preserves the current GitHub/task workflow state for compaction recovery and fresh-agent handoff. GitHub issues remain the execution source of truth; this file is a local memory snapshot.

## Integration Branch

Current feature integration branch:

`codex/inventory-redesign-dev`

Workflow:

- Agents work issues against `codex/inventory-redesign-dev`.
- Issues may be closed once their work lands on the integration branch and verification is recorded.
- `main` remains stable until the integrated feature slice is ready for human review.
- A human reviews the integrated feature before merging `codex/inventory-redesign-dev` into `main`.

## Recommended Next Management Step

Start issue #16:

`Replace hotbar assignment buttons with drop targets`

Why:

- The first inventory grid foundation slice and slot-to-slot drag/drop are complete.
- Hotbar assignment already has a durable backend API.
- This is the smallest next direct-manipulation slice.
- It removes the most awkward `Slot N` hotbar assignment path from the critical player workflow.
- Handoff: `docs/SUNNY_TOWN_HOTBAR_DROP_TARGET_HANDOFF.md`.
